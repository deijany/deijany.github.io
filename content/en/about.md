intro: >-
  PhD researcher in signal processing working on estimation, compensation, synchronization, linearization, and equalization, with a strong focus on robustness under non-ideal hardware effects and noisy conditions. Develops hardware-aware, low-complexity algorithms, including neural-network–inspired linearizers, alongside classical model-based techniques.

study: >-
  I received a B.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering (2015), a Postgraduate Diploma in Medical Physics (2016), and an M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering (2018) from the Higher Institute of Technologies and Applied Sciences (InSTEC), University of Havana, Cuba. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Communication Systems at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University, Sweden.

  Previously, I worked as a Junior Medical Physicist at CECMED (2015–2018) and as a Research Associate at InSTEC (2019–2020). Since 2019, I have been a Junior Associate at ICTP (Trieste, Italy).

#   I am currently completing my Ph.D. at **Linköping University (Sweden)**, with an expected graduation date of **April 2026**. My research is conducted within the **ELLIIT / Beyond-5G baseband processing** context, addressing challenges in wideband communication systems, ADC/DAC non-idealities, and efficient digital signal processing. 

# mix: >-
#   I have a multidisciplinary background spanning **communications engineering**, **signal processing**, and **applied machine learning**. Prior to my Ph.D., I worked in **medical physics and Monte Carlo modeling**, which strengthened my experience with numerical methods, simulation, and data-driven modeling. This background allows me to approach problems from both a **theoretical** and **practical implementation** perspective.

passion_title: "Research Interests"

passion_text: >-
  My main research interests include estimation and synchronization, hardware-constrained signal processing, linearization of non-ideal ADC/DAC response, and equalization of frequency-response distortions. I am particularly interested in methods that balance theoretical rigor, robustness, and computational efficiency for deployment on real hardware and at scale. A recurring theme in my work is the use of learning-inspired and unsupervised methods to discover structure, tune models, and improve performance when labeled data is limited.

personal: >-
  Outside research, I enjoy sports, reading, music, technical writing, and collaborative board games.
